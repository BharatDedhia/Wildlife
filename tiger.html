            <b>Top 10 facts about tigers</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1. TIGERS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE A WHILE</b><br><br>
            Tigers were around about 2 million years ago.<br><br>

            <b>2. HOWEVER, THANKS TO HUMANS, TIGERS ARE NOW ENDANGERED</b><br><br>
            Over the last 150 years, the tigers' range has shrunk by nearly 95%. There are estimated 
            to be around 3,900 tigers left in the wild.<br><br>

            <b>3. 3. CAPTIVE VS WILD</b><br><br>
            There are more tigers in captivity in the US than are left in the wild.

        <p><b>4. INDIA IS THE COUNTRY WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF WILD TIGERS</b><br><br>
            Around 3,000 of the world's wild tigers are in India<br><br>

          <b>5. SILENT HUNTERS</b><br><br>
          Tigers have soft toe pads which help them walk silently through their habitat. A tiger will 
          typically travel 6-12 miles during a night’s hunting. During the day, a tiger’s stripes can 
          act as camouflage, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings for stalking and ambushing 
          its prey.<br><br>

          <b>6. ONE MAIN MEAL A WEEK</b><br><br>
          Tigers primarily hunt deer, but as opportunistic predators, they can also eat wild boars, birds, 
          fish, rodents, amphibians, reptiles, and even insects. A large deer can provide a tiger with one 
          week's food, but only one out of every ten hunts is successful.

        <p><b>7. THEY’RE PROTECTIVE OVER THEIR KILL</b><br><br>
          Tigers don't usually eat their prey at the kill site - but instead drag their prey into cover to feed. If a tiger leaves - 
          say to get a drink - it will cover it's kill by raking leaves, dirt, grass and even rocks over the carcass.<br><br>
          
          <b>8. CHATTY CATS</b><br><br>
          The vocal repertoire of tigers is vast - they grunt, growl, roar, moan, snarl, chuff, hiss and gasp. It's thought that each 
          vocalisation is used to communicate different things.<br><br>

          <b>9. RUMOUR HAS IT…</b><br><br>
          It's been said that tiger urine smells like buttered popcorn.<br><br>
          
          <b>10. WWF ARE WORKING TO PROTECT THE TIGER</b><br><br>
          WWF’s goal is to help secure a viable future for wild tigers, with representation across their historic range, in coexistence 
          with Indigenous Peoples and local communities​.
